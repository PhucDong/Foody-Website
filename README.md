## Description
This is the final project of the HTML &amp; CSS course for beginners taught by Nordic Coder.

## Motivation
I enrolled in the course because I'm interested in becoming a front-end developer.

## Tools
[fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery): lets developers choose free icons and them to their project.

[bennettfeely](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/): allows developers to add customized shapes using CSS's clip-path property.
