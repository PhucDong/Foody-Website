# Foody-Website
The final project of the HTML &amp; CSS course for beginners taught by Nordic Coder.


## Motivation
I enrolled in the course because I'm interested in front-end development. Learning HTML and CSS is the starting point, and Nordic Coder is the only coding bootcamp in Ho Chi Minh city I could find to get me closer to becoming a front-end developer.
